| **toc**        |  `false`   | Generate Table of Contents                        |

## Autoreload

When enabled the extension will make a GET request every second to markdown files hosted on:

- `file:///` URLs
- any host that resolves to localhost IPv4 `127.0.0.1` or IPv6 `::1`

## Emoji

Convert emoji :shortnames: into EmojiOne images:

- Emoji shortnames like `:smile:` will be converted to :smile: using EmojiOne images.
- Currently unicode symbols like `ðŸ˜„` and ASCII emoji like `:D` are not supported.

## MathJax

The following MathJax delimiters are supported:

- inline math: `\(math\)` and `$math$`
- display math: `\[math\]` and `$$math$$`

The following rules apply to your markdown content when MathJax is enabled:

- Regular dollar sign `$` in text that is not part of a math formula should be escaped: `\$`
- Regular markdown escaping for parentheses: `\(` and `\)`, and brackets: `\[` and `\]` is not supported. MathJax will convert anything between these delimiters to math formulas, unless they are wrapped in backticks: `` `\(` `` or fenced code blocks.

## Mermaid

Render Mermaid diagrams wrapped in `mmd` or `mermaid` fenced code blocks:

    ```mmd
    sequenceDiagram
    ```

Alternatively diagrams can be wrapped in HTML tags:

```html
<pre><code class="mermaid">
  sequenceDiagram
</code></pre>
```

- resize the diagram container vertically by dragging the bottom right corner of the code block up or down
- zoom in and out by holding down the Shift key and then using your mouse wheel
- pan by holding down the left mouse button and drag in any direction

## Syntax

Syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks:

    ```js
    var hello = 'hi'
    ```

Alternatively code blocks can be wrapped in HTML tags:

```html
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">var hello = 'hi'</code></pre>
```

> Full list of supported languages and their corresponding [aliases][prism-lang] to use.

## ToC

Generates Table of Contents (ToC) based on the headers found in the markdown document.

---

# Manage Origins

Click on the Markdown Viewer icon and select `Advanced Options`.

By default Markdown Viewer does not have access to any content:

![img-no-access]

## Enable File Access

To enable access to file URLs follow [these steps](#local-files).

In case access to local files was not enabled, an additional `Allow Access` button will be present next to the File Access header:

![img-file-access-allow]

Clicking on it will point you to the built-in management page for the extension where you can toggle the `Allow access to file URLs` switch to enable it.

## Enable Site Access

Access to individual sites can be enabled by copy/pasting a URL address into the Site Access text box and then clicking on the `Add` button next to it:

![img-site-access-add]

> Access to both `http` and `https` protocols can be enabled by using a wildcard `*://raw.githubusercontent.com`

> Access to all subdomains for a given hostname can be enabled by using a wildcard `https://*.githubusercontent.com`

> Access to all ports on `localhost` can be enabled by adding `http://localhost`.
> Access to a specific port can be enabled by adding `http://localhost:3000`

## Allow on All Sites

Access to **all** sites can be enabled by clicking on the `Allow All` button next to the Site Access header:

![img-site-allow-all]

> This is identical to adding the `*://*` pattern into the text box.

## Content Detection

Each enabled origin has an option for content type header detection and path matching regular expression:

![img-site-access-enabled]

### Header Detection

When this option is enabled the extension will check if the `content-type` header with a value of `text/markdown`, `text/x-markdown` or `text/plain` is present.

### Path Matching

When this option is enabled the extension will check if the page URL matches the Path Matching RegExp.

The default regular expression is: `\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)(?:#.*|\?.*)?$`

It is a simple regular expression that matches URLs ending with:

- markdown file extension: `\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)`
- and optionally a hash or a querystring after that: `(?:#.*|\?.*)?`

> The `?:` used in `(?:match)` stands for *non-capturing group* and it is there for performance reasons.

You can modify the path matching regular expression for each enabled origin. The settings are being updated as you type.

### Path Matching Priority

The enabled origins are matched from most to least specific:

1. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`
2. `https://*.githubusercontent.com`
3. `*://raw.githubusercontent.com`
4. `*://*.githubusercontent.com`
5. `*://*`

The matching origin with the highest priority will be picked and its header detection and path matching settings will be used to determine if the content should be rendered or not.

> It is recommended to explicitly allow only the origins that you want the extension to have access to.

## Remove Origin

Click on the `Remove` button for the origin that you want to remove. This removes the permission itself so that the extension can no longer access that origin.

## Refresh Origin

The extension synchronizes your preferences across all of your devices if you have logged into your browser and enabled the sync feature. The list of your allowed origins is being synced too. However, the actual permissions that you grant using the consent popup cannot be synced.

In case you have enabled a new origin on some of your devices you will have to explicitly allow it on your other devices. In this case the origin will be highlighted and an additional `Refresh` button will be present:

![img-site-refresh]

Only origins that needs to be refreshed will be highlighted. The extension cannot access highlighted origins unless you click on the `Refresh` button.

> In some cases access to previously allowed origins may get disabled. Make sure you check back the advanced options page or reload it and look for highlighted origins that needs to be refreshed.
